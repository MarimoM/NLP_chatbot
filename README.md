## Annotation

This bachelor's thesis contains an investigation of natural language processing classification algorithms for chatbot prototypes. The work aims to compare classification algorithms and choose the most suitable for chatbot prototype creation. The analytical part includes an overview of chatbot types and their basic architecture. This part also contains an analysis of the most popular machine learning classification methods used in chatbot creation, an overview of knowledgebases and data pre-processing methods. In addition, there is an overview of the classification model's evaluation criteria. The practical part consists of investigation goals and plan alignment, criteria used for model effectiveness evaluation, data pre-processing, datasets for benchmarking and model rating criteria. Furthermore, an overview of created and tuned classification models, and an analysis of the training process of each model. The research result part consists of the comparison of four classification algorithms and choosing the most suitable algorithm for the chatbot prototype development.
